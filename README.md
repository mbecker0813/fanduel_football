An R script to create optimal football lineups for FanDuel for use in 50/50 and Head to Head contests
On FanDuel.com, go to the contest you would like to participate in and navigate to the lineup entry page. You will see a "Download players list" link - download this, save it as "football.csv", and make sure it is in your working directory along with the R script.
The resulting CSV file is in an importable format using the player ID's and names. You can download a mass import template from FanDuel's lineup entry page as well or you can just use the resulting CSV file to manually enter a lineup.
## DISCLAIMER: I do not claim responsibility for your gambling habits - these are still real people with ups and downs so the optimal lineups this R script creates still may not win. If it was perfect, I'd be a millionaire by now!
